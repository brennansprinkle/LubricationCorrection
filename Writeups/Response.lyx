Sprinkle et al.
 presented an impressive work on algorithms for improving large-scale Brownian
 Dynamics simulations...
 I find the algorithms presented in this work novel and interesting.
 They provide a new way of thinking about hydrodynamic interactions in Brownian
 suspensions, and therefore are not limited to the multi-blob methods.
 This work is clearly presented and well-written.

I am a bit puzzled by authors' decision of not using well-known systems
 such as Brownian spherical suspensions as the algorithm validation standard.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several reasons we did not choose standard sphere suspension tests
 for this work.
 The first reason is that this work is focused on BD for particles above
 a no-slip wall, not on periodic (bulk) suspensions, for which most results
 are available.
 This stems from our own application interests and recent interest in active
 suspensions, in which the particles are usually above a bottom floor.
 While all of the algorithms and approaches presented here do apply to periodic
 systems (based on the PSE method of Swan), there are some optimizations
 that can be performed for periodic domains because the divergence of the
 blob-blob mobility matrix vanishes for the periodic RPY tensor.
 Also, some of the tradeoffs between the cost of different pieces of the
 solvers change, as we discuss in the conclusions â€“ the methods here are
 really tuned to the specific geometry we study.
 The second reason is that in previous deterministic work on the rigid multiblob
 method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "RigidMultiblobs"

\end_inset

 we already compared to Stokesian Dynamics and other methods for spherical
 suspensions.
 When noise is added, they key challenge is capturing the correct Gibbs-Boltzman
n equilibrium distribution, and this aspect is already tested in detail
 in the examples studied here.
 The third reason is that one of the key strengths/differences of our work
 is being able to handle non-spherical particles, so we wanted to emphasize
 that in the tests.
 There are already good methods that are specifically tailored to spherical
 suspensions, including recent boundary-integral based formulations

 Mobility preconditioner in Sec.
 IIB: the idea of using the self-hydrodynamic interactions as the preconditioner
 to accelerate the convergence of iterative methods have been widely used,
 although with slight modifications from different authors.
 This may be worthwhile to point out.
 A few examples come to mind include the preconditioners by Saintillan et
 al.
 (Phys.
 Fluids 17, 2005, 03301) for fibers with slender body theory, Keaveny (J.
 Comp.
 Phys.
 269, 2014, 61) for the force coupling method, and Wang & Brady (J.
 Comp.
 Phys.
 306, 2016, 443) for Stokesian Dynamics.
 There are probably more and the authors should include them as well.

Indeed, there are probably many works that do this, for example, it is quite
 common in the boundary integral community.

 to the paper.
 The key contribution of our work is not the simple idea of diagonal or
 block-diagonal preconditioners, rather, it is in demonstrating how well
 these work and also some studies of how sensitive they are to approximations
 in the diagonal blocks

 Origin of Brownian drift (beginning of Sec.
 III): Lau & Lubensky (Phys.
 Rev.
 E, 76, 2007, 011123) discussed extensively the physical origin of the Brownian
 drift from the configuration-dependent thermal fluctuations.
 They showed that there is only one thermodynamically consistent interpretation.
 It would be nice to point this out to clear the widespread confusion when
 interpreting Langevin equations as stochastic differential equations (Ito
 vs.
 Stratovich, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This issue was settled many decades ago before the work of Lau & Lubensky.
 In fact, much of the more recent work on this adds, in our opinion, more
 confusion than clarification because prior work has been forgotten.
 We cite instead a decade older and more precise paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T\ \partial_{\V Q}\cdot\N$

thermal drift
\shape default
 (or sometimes simply the

 this drift term would disappear if the so-called kinetic or Klimontovich
 interpretation of the noise is used

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the benefit of the reviewer, we not the following things.
 First, the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

alpha interpretation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the noise popularized in recent works fails in dimension higher than
 one and so does not really have a physical significance (the Ito and the
 kinetic interpetations do).
 Second, it is relatively easy to show that there is only one form of the
 equations (say if one picks Ito for the convention/notation) that is consistent
 with detailed balance, i.e., time reversibility at equilibrium, once one
 fixes either the deterministic term or the covariance of the noise.
 Third, the Strato interpretation cannot possibly be the right one for state-dep
endent noise covariance since the drift in Strato depends not just on the
 covariance 
\begin_inset Formula $\N$
\end_inset

 but on 
\begin_inset Formula $\N^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

, which is unphysical.
 We believe one should only use either the Ito or the kinetic interpretation
 in BD.
 Kinetic is the natural one for the Fixman midpoint scheme, and Ito for
 Euler-Maruyuama based schemes such as our RFD scheme.

 The concept of random finite difference (RFD) in p.
 10 was shown in Banchio & Brady (Ref.
 6 in the manuscript) back in 2003 for Stokesian Dynamics (their Sec.
 IID) when computing the Brownian drift and stress.
 Although with multi-blob the mathematical description becomes more involved,
 the idea remains largely the same.
 The RFD used in Banchio & Brady should be acknowledged in the manuscript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of Banchio & Brady adds the notion of a step size 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 to the classic Fixman midpoint scheme, but it does not generalize the idea
 of Fixman sufficiently â€“ it still requires sampling random 
\emph on
forces
\emph default
 instead of random 
\emph on
displacements
\emph default
, which is much more scalable and fits naturally in BD based on mobility
 solvers.
 We clarified some of this in the revised text:

6.
 The authors should emphasize the general nature of the time integration
 algorithms and the constrained mechanisms of the multi-blob method.
 In fact, none of the algorithms in Sec.
 II and III are specific to confined systems.
 Confinement is only reflected through validation examples in this work.
 It would be interesting to see if the algorithms can be applied to complex
 swimmers under Brownian motion, such as the ones described in Swan et al.
 (Phys.
 Fluids 23, 2011, 071901)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Confinement is important to this work not just for the examples but also
 in two other ways.
 First, for bulk or periodic suspensions the divergence of the RPY mobility
 matrix is zero and this simplification has been used in a number of existing
 approaches, but cannot be used with confinement.
 Second, the scalable computation of Brownian displacements, which is crucial
 in the schemes, relies on confinement (more precisely, the screening of
 hydrodynamic interactions by the wall) in this specific paper.
 For example, as of now there is no linear-scaling method to compute Brownian
 increments in an unbounded domain, which is what the simulations of Swan
 et al.
 mentioned by the reviewer do.
 The long-ranged 
\begin_inset Formula $1/r$
\end_inset

 decay of the hydrodynamic interactions and the lack of a finite domain
 to grid make this harder to do, although there are recent promising approaches
 that we hope to be able to utilize in the future 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, we appreciate the reviewer's point and agree that this is
 important to emphasize more.
 The generality of the approach and avenues for extending to other geometries
 was discussed in greatest detail the conclusions.
 We have now added a sentence to the introduction 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Furthermore, while we focus here on suspensions confined above a no-slip
 wall, the methods we present here are rather general and can be applied
 to other systems such as bulk passive or active suspensions.

 and also to the opening of Section III: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 For some examples the only driving mechanism is the Brownian motion.
 For some others, including the micro-rollers there is a combination of
 Brownian motion, forcing by the external torques and settling due to gravity.
 The problem is posed in dimensional units but it would help to translate
 some this into a Peclet number or similar to classify the relative role
 of Brownian motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the linear response theory computation of the long-time diffusion coefficien
t of a pair of boomerangs we already included an estimate of the PÃ©clet
 number in the revision, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pe}=L\,F/\left(k_{B}T\right)\approx0.5$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $L=2.1\mu\text{m}$
\end_inset

 is the boomerang arm length.
 For the example of the microrollers, we have now added estimates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Note that the mean velocity obtained from the most-resolved computations
 leads to an estimate of the PÃ©clet number 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pe}=\left(6\pi\eta\right)R_{h}^{2}\bar{V}/\left(k_{B}T\right)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pe}\approx22$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pe}\approx39$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 This indicates that the horizontal motion is dominated by the active flow.
 However, the Brownian motion is important for setting the height of the
 particles above the bottom wall, as can be seen from the fact that the
 distribution of heights 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(h\right)$
\end_inset

 is not changed significantly by the active motion.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have not found a good way to quantify with a dimensionless number the
 relative importance of Brownian motion versus active flow in the vertical
 direction, but we know from comparisons of non-Brownian versus Brownian
 simulations that fluctuations 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 important in setting the height above the wall, which controls the dynamics
 in this example.
 Therefore, this example could not be studied quantitatively without our
 new methods.

 The labeling and caption of Figure 1 could be improved.
 This figure is first discussed in the text on page 8 but the context is
 not given until section IVB.
 The explanation on page 8 could be a bit more informative.
 The convergence with both external forcing and Brownian motion is considered,
 as is the role of pre-conditioning.
 The legend presumably implies a grouping of the data by the algorithm and
 then by the resolution.
